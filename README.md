# Potato-Disease-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
The Project presents detection of early plant diseases to decrease the plant’s production losses by developing an end to end application that employs diagnosis and detection.
This system is developed as an end-end web application, built by concepts relating to Deep Learning and Web Development.

Deep learning system based on the Convolution Neural Network (CNN). We used CNN to extract the diseases features from the input images. We’ll start with collecting the data where the data is brought into tf dataset then model building, and build a web-based application, in other words a full- stack website with the help of backend development and front end development.

In the case of disease prevention, the farmer can upload the images of potato plant onto the web application to find out the condition of the plant. Hence the farmer can utilize adequate treatment methods to overcome the hardships.
